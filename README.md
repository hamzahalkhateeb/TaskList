# TaskList
A full-stack To-Do List app built with Angular and .NET Web API. Users can add, view, and delete tasks, create subtasks with an auto-updating progress bar, and view tasks on a calendar by date. With modular architecture, clean code, and tested endpoints, it highlights modern full-stack development practices.
